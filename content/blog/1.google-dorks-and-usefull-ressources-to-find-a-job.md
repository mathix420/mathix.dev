# Introduction

It's time, your searching a new job or your first job in IT, you've applied to the company you love and was hopping so much to get a positive response but it wasn't (thanks PostHog) and you're now lost in the sea of job offerings ðŸ« . Don't worry I got you covered.

# Google Dorks

## [Rapha](https://withrapha.com), the most human recruiting platform

I've found that Rapha is so far the most human way of applying/reviewing to job offerings.
So here are a few dorks allowing you to find offers on their platform:

**Find remote full-time roles that also offers equity.**
```
site:app.withrapha.com "equity" "full-time" "remote"
```

**Find remote full-time roles for react engineers.**
```
site:app.withrapha.com "react" "full-time" "remote"
```

**Find remote full-time roles offering big salaries.**
```
site:app.withrapha.com "competitive" "full-time" "remote"
```

> Keep in mind that google probably don't index/shows everything. But that's still a good way to find offers that match your needs.


## [Ashby](https://ashbyhq.com), preferred by fast pace startups

Here is another platform where you can focus your research.

```
site:jobs.ashbyhq.com "remote" "engineer"
```

## workatastartup.com

## https://web3.career/

https://web3.career/


## Notion

```
site:notion.site "career"
```

```
site:notion.site "jobs"
```

## Wrokable

```
site:apply.workable.com
```

# Follow.app

Follow is a new fancy rss reader, it's still in invite-only, but other rss readers exists out there. The interesting part is [RSSHub](https://docs.rsshub.app/) a self-hostable tool to turn any website into a RSS feed.

I've used it to generate RSS feeds for multiple job offering websites:

**swissdevjobs.ch**
```
/rsshub/transform/json/https%3A%2F%2Fswissdevjobs.ch%2Fapi%2FjobsLight/title=Swiss%20IT%20Jobs&itemTitle=name&itemLink=jobUrl&itemLinkPrefix=https%3A%2F%2Fswissdevjobs.ch%2Fjobs%2F&itemPubDate=activeFrom&itemDesc=language
```

**workatastartup.com**
```
rsshub://hackernews/jobs
```
