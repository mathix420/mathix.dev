# Google Dorks and Useful Resources to Find Your Dream Job in IT

Searching for a new job, or even your first, in IT can feel daunting. Maybe youâ€™ve already applied to your dream company, hoping for that positive response, but it didnâ€™t work out. Now, you're navigating through a sea of job listings ðŸ« . But donâ€™t worryâ€”Iâ€™ve got you covered!

## Google Dorks

### Rapha, the Most Human Recruiting Platform

[Rapha](https://withrapha.com) stands out as one of the most human-centric ways to apply for job opportunities. Although they donâ€™t list jobs directly on their platform, here are a few Google dorks to help you find roles that match your preferences:

**Find remote, full-time roles that offer equity.**
```
site:app.withrapha.com "equity" "full-time" "remote"
```

**Find remote, full-time roles for React engineers.**
```
site:app.withrapha.com "react" "full-time" "remote"
```

**Find remote, full-time roles with competitive salaries.**
```
site:app.withrapha.com "competitive" "full-time" "remote"
```

> Remember, Google may not index or display all listings, but these searches can help you discover companies and offers that match your criteria.

### Ashby, Preferred by Fast-Paced Startups

[Ashby](https://ashbyhq.com) is another platform where you can target your job search effectively:

```
site:jobs.ashbyhq.com "remote" "engineer"
```

### Lever

```
site:jobs.lever.co "remote" "engineer"
```

### Notion

Many startups post jobs on Notion pages, making it a hidden gem for unique listings.

```
site:notion.site "career"
```

```
site:notion.site "jobs"
```

### Workable

Workable is widely used by companies of all sizes, offering diverse roles with straightforward applications.

```
site:apply.workable.com
```

### Job Boards

- The YC Startup Jobs board lists positions at Y Combinator-backed companies, perfect for those interested in high-growth startups.

## Follow.app

Follow is a sleek, new RSS reader currently in invite-only mode. For alternatives, there are other RSS readers. The interesting feature here is [RSSHub](https://docs.rsshub.app/), a self-hostable tool that can convert any website into an RSS feed.

I use it to generate RSS feeds for multiple job sites:

**swissdevjobs.ch**
```
/rsshub/transform/json/https%3A%2F%2Fswissdevjobs.ch%2Fapi%2FjobsLight/title=Swiss%20IT%20Jobs&itemTitle=name&itemLink=jobUrl&itemLinkPrefix=https%3A%2F%2Fswissdevjobs.ch%2Fjobs%2F&itemPubDate=activeFrom&itemDesc=language
```

**workatastartup.com**
```
rsshub://hackernews/jobs
```
