# Use Google Dorks to Find Your Dream Job

You may already be familiar with [Google Dorks](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_hacking) â€” a technique that use specially crafted Google queries to find known vulnerabilities on indexed websites â€” but did you know those special queries can also help you find your dream job?

Most software used by HR these days donâ€™t list jobs directly on their platform, you need to find the list from the company's website or on LinkedIn.

See below a collection of Google Dorks that will list all these jobs offerings. Tweak those dorks to match your needs.

## Rapha

Rapha seems to be preferred by startups yet, and allows you to apply to job offerings by sending voice messages.

Have a looks at those dorks, allowing you to list job offerings available on Rapha.

**Find remote, full-time roles that offer equity.**

```text
site:app.withrapha.com "equity" "full-time" "remote"
```

**Find remote, full-time roles for React engineers.**

```text
site:app.withrapha.com "react" "full-time" "remote"
```

**Find remote, full-time roles with competitive salaries.**

```

> Remember, Google may not index or display all listings, but these searches can help you discover companies and offers that match your criteria.

## Ashby

Seems to be preferred by fast-paced startups.

Another one focused on AI.

Many startups post jobs on Notion pages, making it a hidden gem for unique listings.

Workable is widely used by companies of all sizes, offering diverse roles with straightforward applications.

## Follow\.app

Follow is a sleek, new RSS reader currently in invite-only mode. For alternatives, there are other RSS readers. The interesting feature here is [RSSHub](https://docs.rsshub.app/), a self-hostable tool that can convert any website into an RSS feed.

I use it to generate RSS feeds for multiple job sites:

**swissdevjobs.ch**

```text
/rsshub/transform/json/https%3A%2F%2Fswissdevjobs.ch%2Fapi%2FjobsLight/title=Swiss%20IT%20Jobs&itemTitle=name&itemLink=jobUrl&itemLinkPrefix=https%3A%2F%2Fswissdevjobs.ch%2Fjobs%2F&itemPubDate=activeFrom&itemDesc=language
```

**workatastartup.com**

```text

```
