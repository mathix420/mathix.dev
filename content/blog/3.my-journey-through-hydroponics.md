# My Journey Through Hydroponics

It's been a while since I wanted to start growing my own greens using hydroponics, and I finally started! I will use this article to share my experiences planning and setting up my first hydroponic system.

## The requirements

- Growing lettuce
- Deep Water Culture (DWC)
- Fully indoor
- Food grade materials only (no PVC!)
- As cheap and simple as possible
- Low maintenance requirement
- Home assistant integration ðŸ˜‡

That's it, now let's choose the parts.

## The parts

Keep in mind that everything needs to be 100% food safe, you don't want nasty chemicals in your lettuce, don't you?

So stick with Polypropylene (PP) or other food safe plastics.

- 4x IKEA UPPSNOFSAD boxes with lids
- 2x IKEA SKOGSVIKEN soap boxes as seed trays
- 24x net cups (I've used 55x50mm conical ones)
- Nutrient solution, an organic one is best
- White LEDs at least 5000K for green leaves
- A fan

To be continued...
