# Manifesto

> This isn't a Bible, definitive, nor objective.
> I've found that following these points—most of the time—leads to better success in work and life yet.

1. Keep it simple.
   * Did you enjoyed the last time you've used something not simple?
2. 8/8/8
   * Hours of sleep, work and life.
3. Don't forget your first idea.
   * Don't get lost, first ideas are often best.
4. Segment work & life.
   * Said 100 times but still underestimated.
5. If it's < 10min, do it.
   * Thinking about a task, if it's less than 10min, do it now.
6. Don't let customization become a feature.
   * Or every users not finding the exact setting they want will be disappointed.
