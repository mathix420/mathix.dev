# Manifesto

> This isn't a Bible, definitive, nor objective.
> I've found that following these points—most of the time—leads to better success in work and life yet.

1. Keep it simple.
   * Even complexity can be simple.
2. Make your own opinion.
   * Experiencing something can be the only way to learn it.
3. 8/8/8
   * Hours of sleep, work and life.
4. Don't forget first idea.
   * People will probably think the same first time seeing your product.
5. Segment work & life.
   * Said 100 times but still underestimated.
6. If it's < 10min, do it.
   * Thinking about a task, if it's less than 10min, do it now.
